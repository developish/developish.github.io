================

With my laptop stolen and my main development machine now being a 2011 MacBook
Air with 4 GB of RAM, I'm starting to think about ways that I can be more
flexible about my workflow. For instance, does it make sense to spin up an AWS
machine instead of running a local virtual machine with Vagrant? As part of
that I'm also trying to figure out ways that I can lower the resistance to
getting some coding or writing done by using iOS. 

My iPad Air 2 was also a casualty of this theft, but I do have an older iPad
Mini that works just fine, so I'm testing out doing work in Git using [Working
Copy][working-copy]. It's a Git client for iOS, so given that this blog is on
GitHub Pages, then this post will be published through it.

I suppose if you're reading this then it worked, huh?
