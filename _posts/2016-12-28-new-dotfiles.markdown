title:  New Dotfiles

{{ page.title }}
================

I recently had my laptop stolen, and even though I had backups, now seems like
a good time to start over with [my dotfiles][dotfiles]. I want to re-build them
somewhat slowly, and really learn to use the lower level parts of the OS and
older established tools.

For example, rather than something like Ruby, I'm [using GNU Stow to manage
them][dotfiles-with-stow].

If you [follow them on GitHub][dotfiles] you might even learn something, as I'm
going to try to write [good commit messages][git-commit-messages] as I build
them.
