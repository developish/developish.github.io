title:  Starting Over

{{ page.title }}
================

This has not been a great year for me. I need a do over.

Starting this blog (again) is a way for me to practice putting things "out
there", which I'm not good at. I've attempted to start blogging many times in
the past but it's never become a habit. The reason - I'm a perfectionist. It's
incredibly challenging for me to publish something without tremendous internal
resistance, probably because I fear the potential criticism that could come my
way.

That, of course, is a ridiculous reason not to do something.
